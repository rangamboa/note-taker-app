## Description

Note Taker App can accept input from the user as a note title/body pair and stores it in a server-side file. The user is able to write, edit and delete notes using a slick, simple interface. This application has also been deployed to Heroku, although it is non-functional in its current state üôÅ

## Installation

This project was built using Express.js back-end and retrieves note data written in JSON. Install node and npm to use this application from the command line if you don't already have them on your local machine.

## Usage

Use ``node .\index.js`` to launch this application. Once fully functional, it will launch a webpage that will give you the option to enter notes on a separate page, to be saved and later retrieved if desired.
